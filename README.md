# Churn modelling (Machine Learning)
Project created for *Practical Machine Learning in Python* (org. *Praktyczny Macine Learning w Pythonie*) classes at WNE UW

Language:
 * Polish - classes, notebook

Semester: II (MA studies)

## About
The main objective of this project was to gain some experience, practice and perform own experiments with Machine Learning models learned during classes. The idea was to show my ML journey with this dataset. Moreover I gained some expert knowledge about churn events while working on this project, which is very cool for me (mostly during feature engineering part).
